# Work

Strength training goes hand-in-hand with my professional development. It improves my physical performance, my mental state, and I apply a lot of the same principles to training as I do my career.

## Fitness

My main focus since 2020 has been strength-focused powerlifting routines. These are often simple to follow, and the progression helps keep me motivated. In August of 2023 I reached a personal goal of lifting 1,000 lbs across the 3 main powerlifting compounds: back squat (`340`), bench press (`260`), and deadlift (`400`). Since then, I've been exploring powerbuilding and bodybuilding programs, trying to improve my diet, and inconsistently integrating daily cardio sessions.

Goals:

1. Improve cardiovascular performance
2. Start doing static stretches at the end of each day
3. Pick up an athletic hobby (e.g. basketball)
4. Reach 20% body fat
