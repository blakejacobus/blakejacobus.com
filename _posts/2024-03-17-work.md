# Work

[Software engineering](#technology) is my professional concentration right now. Leading up to that, I served in several other roles:

- Infrastructure Engineer
- Product Owner
- Risk Analyst
- Sales Associate
- Cook/Cashier

I primarily develop in Python, but my role also demands a working knowledge of various tools and frameworks used to design, deploy, monitor, and support the software solutions that we create.

[Physical training](#fitness) goes hand-in-hand with my professional development. It improves my performance, my mental state, and I apply a lot of the same principles to training as I do my career.

## Technology

Like most people, I leverage [technology](./technology) in nearly everything I do. I want to share that journey and the things I've learned along the way, for myself and for anyone who may find it useful.

## Fitness

I've logged things like my [journal, programs, and research](./fitness) to encapsulate my fitness experience. It helps me to look back on what has worked well or what I need to keep trying to improve moving forward, but I also hope it provides some insights or inspiration to anyone interested.
