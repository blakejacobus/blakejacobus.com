# Work

I currently [work as a software engineer](#technology). Before that I was an infrastructure engineer, a product owner, a risk analyst, a sales associate, and a food service employee. I mainly develop in Python right now, but my role also demands a working knowledge of various tools and frameworks used to govern, deploy, and support our technical solutions.

[Physical training](#fitness) goes hand-in-hand with my professional development. It improves my physical performance, my mental state, and I apply a lot of the same principles to training as I do my career.

## Technology

Like most people, I leverage [technology](./technology) in nearly everything I do. I want to share that journey and the things I've learned along the way, for myself and for anyone who may find it useful.

## Fitness

I've logged things like my [journal, programs, and research](./fitness) to encapsulate my fitness experience. It helps me to look back on what has worked well or what I need to keep trying to improve moving forward, but I also hope it provides some insights or inspiration to anyone interested.
