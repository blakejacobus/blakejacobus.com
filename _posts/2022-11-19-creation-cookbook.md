# Creation Cookbook

I have registered `creationcookbook.com` so that I can share vegetarian (and vegan) recipes, as well as allergen-friendly cooking tips. The site is not active right now, but I hope to migrate posts there in the near future, with a new color scheme and layout.

## Interim Posts

Until the site is live, recipes will be indexed alphabetically as blog posts here:

### Breakfast

- [Banana Oat Pancakes](./banana-oat-pancakes)
- [Chocolate Chip Pancakes](./chocolate-chip-pancakes)

### Lunch & Dinner

- [Chickpea Chicken Salad](./chickpea-chicken-salad)
- [Sweet Potato Sheet Pan Meal](./sweet-potato-sheet-pan-meal)
- [Black Bean Burgers](./black-bean-burgers)
- [Meatballs](./meatballs)

### Sides

- [Crispy Potatoes](./crispy-potatoes)
- [Roasted Brussel Sprouts](./roasted-brussel-sprouts)
- [Zucchini Parmesan Crisps](./zucchini-parmesan-crisps)

### Desserts

- In progress...

### Drinks
