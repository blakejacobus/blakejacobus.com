# Creation Cookbook

I have registered `creationcookbook.com` so that I can share vegetarian (and vegan) recipes, as well as allergen-friendly cooking tips. The site is not active right now, but I hope to migrate posts there in the near future, with a new color scheme and layout.

## Interim Posts

Until the site is live, recipes will be indexed alphabetically as blog posts here:

- [Chickpea Chicken Salad](./chickpea-chicken-salad)
