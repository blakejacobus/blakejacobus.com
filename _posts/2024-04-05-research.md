# Research


Diet
[Johns Hopkins Medicine - Protein Content of Common Foods](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/bariatrics/_documents/nutrition_protein_content_common_foods.pdf)

Summary
Edamame is a good snack option
Beans and nuts should continue to be used for lunch and dinner
Quinoa is a good rice alternative
Cottage cheese and greek yogurt are best dairy options
Supplements
[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health - Workout Supplements](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/workout-supplements/)

Through trial and error, I've found that the most effective pre/intra workout supplements are:
Creatine HCL, 1500mg
Guarana extract (or caffeine anhydrous), 200mg
Electrolytes

For nutritional supplementation, I use:
Multivitamin
Fish oil
30g pea protein, mixed into cold water
	
Creatine
What kind to take
Still working on HCL versus monohydrate research.
How much to take
Based on the following studies and articles, I landed on the following philosophy for creatine consumption: take routine, moderate dose daily, separate from caffeine intake by several hours and lots of water.

Summary
5/3/1 sets of 1-5 reps @ 80-95% 1RM
Hypertrophy
[Maximizing Muscle Hypertrophy: A Systematic Review of Advanced Resistance Training Techniques and Methods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950543/)

In summary, foundations for individuals seeking to maximize muscle growth should be hypertrophy-oriented RT consisting of multiple sets (3-6) of 6-12 repetitions with short rest intervals (60s) and moderate intensity of effort (60−80% 1RM) with subsequent increases in training volume (12–28 sets/muscle/week) [20]

To maintain high time-efficiency of training and when time limitations exist, the use of agonist–antagonist, upper–lower body supersets, drop sets, sarcoplasm stimulating training (SST), and cluster sets may provide an advantage to the traditional approach.

Furthermore, the employment of fast but controlled tempo of the eccentric phase (~2 s) and supplementation of high-load RT with low-load RT under blood flow restriction (BFR) may allow for high time-efficiency of training and prevent excessively long training sessions.

Summary
3-6 sets of 6-12 reps @ 60−80% 1RM
Fast but controlled (~2s) eccentric movements
Target 60s rest and 12-28 sets/muscle/week (train each muscle group 2-3 times per week)
