# Fitness

## Journey

My main focus since 2020 has been strength-focused powerlifting routines. These are often simple to follow, and the progression helps keep me motivated. In August of 2023 I reached a personal goal of lifting 1,000 lbs across the 3 main powerlifting compounds: back squat (`340`), bench press (`260`), and deadlift (`400`). Since then, I've been exploring powerbuilding and bodybuilding programs, trying to improve my diet, and inconsistently integrating daily cardio sessions.

## Log

Over time and between many programs, I've tried to log notes and learnings that improved my efficiency and/or results.
