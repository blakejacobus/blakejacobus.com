# Programs

## Adopted/Adapted

Programs I've used:

- [531](https://forums.t-nation.com/t/5-3-1-how-to-build-pure-strength/281694) for fundamental powerlifting strength.
  - [Boring But Big](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/531-bbb/) to add hypertrophy to 531.
  - [Building The Monolith](https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/building-monolith-spreadsheet/) if you hate yourself.
  - [First Set Last](https://liftvault.com/resources/first-set-last-fsl/) if you want additional strength volume; similar to nSuns.
- [nSuns](https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/) to maximize strength volume and integrate accessory compounds.
- [PHAT](https://liftvault.com/programs/bodybuilding/phat-spreadsheet/)
- [Reddit PPL](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/reddit-ppl/)

## Created

Programs I've modified/created:

- [543](./2024-03-16-543.md) for moderate strength progression and hypertrophy volume balance.
