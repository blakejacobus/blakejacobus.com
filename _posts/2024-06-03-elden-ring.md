    > After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the **Shattering**, the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the **Capital** and the south gate leading here. <br>
    > As you might have guessed, the seals are still active, making entry to the academy impossible without a **glintstone key**. <br>
    > `Sellen` was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy...But `Sellen` was expelled from the academy. Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch.
