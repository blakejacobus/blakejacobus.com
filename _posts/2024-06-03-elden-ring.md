## Journey 

### Limgrave

- `White Mask Varre`, a mysterious man near `Stranded Graveyard`, prompted me to follow the guidance of grace to `Castle Stormveil` and confront `Godrick the Grafted`
- `Kale`, purveyor of fine goods
- `Melina` appeared at a site of grace and offered an alliance
    > I can play the role of maiden. Turning rune fragments into strength. To aid you in your search for the **Elden Ring**. You need only take me with you. To the foot of the **Erdtree**. <br>
    > Upon the cliff, in `Castle Stormveil`, is a shardbearer. A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered **Elden Ring**. <br>
    > I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the **Erdtree** long ago.
- `Usher of Death, Rosus`, statue indicating nearby dungeons/catacombs
    > Guide and gatekeeper for those returning to the roots
- `Stormfoot Catacombs`
    > A proper death means returning to the **Erdtree**. Have patience. Until the time comes, and the roots call to you.
    - Picked up *Grave Glovewort* and *Ghost Glovewort*
    - Defeated `Erdtree Burial Watchdog` and collected *Noble Sorcerer Ashes*
- `Church of Dragon Communion`, located off the western coast, can be used to exchange dragon hearts for spells
- `Heartbroken Maiden` (inside `Stormhill Shack`) reported that people are being grafted, their body parts added to *the spider* and their remains turned into *chrysalids*
- `Knight Bernahl`, a **Tarnished**, inside `Warmaster's Shack` offered to teach me "battle arts" (*Ashes of War*)
- `Witch Renna`, arrived at the `Church of Elleh` and gave me the *Spirit Calling Bell*, a gift from the former master of `Torrent`
    > How long will it be, I wonder, before the **Tarnished** tire of obeisance to the *Two Fingers*?
- `Bloody Finger Hunter Yura` chastised me about challenging `Flying Dragon Agheel` but also aided me in the fight against `Bloody Finger Nerijus`
    > I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers. Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. <br>
    > Just remember, no kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
- `Patches the Untethered`, a **Tarnished**, attacked me in `Murkwater Cave` and then surrendered, offering to sell me goods in the future.
    - Items of note: *Margit's Shackle* and *Stonesword Key*, both 5,000 runes
- `Finger Reader Crone`, east of `Castle Stormveil`, read my fingers...
    > Head to the foundation of gold, **Tarnished**. Traverse `Raya Lucaria`; *"Glintstone Eventide"*, and reunite the *half-crescents*, at the `Grand Lift`.
- `Melina` brought me to `Roundtable Hold` after I reached `Liurnia of the Lakes` by taking a hidden path around `Castle Stormveil`
    > Gathering place of **Tarnished** champions, guided by **Grace**
- `Boc the Seamster` appeared as a tree and referenced a local cave that he was driven out of
    - He was beaten by the demi-humans in `Coastal Cave`. I killed the creatures there and retrieved his *Sewing Needle*
- `Alexander, Iron Fist` warrior jar, was stuck in the ground east of `Castle Stormveil`
    - I freed him, and he gave me *Exalted Flesh*
    - He is traveling eastward to `Redmane Castle` on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted `Caelid Wilds`, where a festival is going to be held
- `Deathtouched Catacombs`
    - Outside the entrance, a spirit lamented
    > Unthinkable. Our hallowed resting plkace is violated. To refuse the Erdtree's call to return, to live within Death...sickening.
    - Defeated `Black Knife Assasin` and collected *Deathroot*, which is is sought after by *Beast Clergyman*
- `Sorcerous Sellen`, found inside `Waypoint Ruins`
    - Exiled from `Raya Lucaria Academy`
    - Offered to teach me sorceries
- `Sorcerer Thops`, inside the `Church of Irith` provided some useful information regarding the `Academy of Raya Lucaria` and the **Erdtree Capital**
    > After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the **Shattering**, the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the **Capital** and the south gate leading here. <br>
    > As you might have guessed, the seals are still active, making entry to the academy impossible without a **glintstone key**. <br>
    > `Sellen` was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy...But `Sellen` was expelled from the academy. Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch.

#### Stormveil Castle

- `Sorcerer Rogier`, located in a chapel in the northwest region of `Stormveil Castle`, offered to teach me some battle arts, as a fellow **Tarnished**
    - Left a message
        > Surely what you seek is somewhere close by...
    - Led me to into the castle's crypt, where I defeated an `Ulcerated Tree Spirit` and discovered the following: 
        - Bloodstain of `Sorcerer Rogier` being killed
        - *Prince of Death's Pustule*
        - Massive petrified skeleton down here, of which only the head, sprouting tentacles, remains...
- `Nepheli Loux`, located near the `Secluded Cell` in `Stormveil Castle`, is another Tarnished operating on orders from her father.
    > If you intend to challenge Godrick, I ask you call upon me. The winds run could with his deeds. I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight.
    - Relation to `Hoarah Loux` from the [introduction](#introduction)?
- `Godrick the Grafted` defeated
    - Obtained *Godrick's Great Rune*
        > The **Great Runes** you receive by defeating **shardbearers** have lost their beneficial power. However, their power can be restored at **Divine Towers** throughout the `Lands Between`
        > See the description of each **Great Rune** to discover which **Divine Tower** you should visit.
        - Seek the `Divine Tower of Limgrave`, which stands beyond the great bridge from `Stormveil Castle`
            - Restored the rune at the tower, in what appears to be a petrified version of two fingers sprouting from the ground
                > The **Great Rune** is known as the anchor ring, found in the center of the **Elden Ring**
                > The first demigods were The **Elden Lord Godfrey** and his offspring, the **golden lineage**
    - Obtained *Remembrance of the Grafted*
        - Power can be unlocked by the **Finger Reader**    
            - Unlocks *Axe of Godrick* or *Grafted Dragon*, neither of which I care for
            - Remembrances can be duplicated at a `Wandering Mausoleum`. Only one remembrance may be duplicated per mausoleum, and only one time.

### Roundtable Hold

- `Brother Corhyn`
    > I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the *Two Fingers*, and explore the secrets of the Golden Order.
- `Gideon Ofnir`
    > Oh, this is a rare occasion. I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable. Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome. It is safe here. You may let down your guard. <br>
    > Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune. <br>
    > Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open. And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.
    - Welcomed me after defeating `Godrick` and offered information on the remaining 4 demigods:
        - `Radahn` in the `Caelid Wilds`
        - `Rykard` in `Mt. Gelmir`, west of the `Altus Plateau`; the realm of the **Erdtree**
        - `Morgott the Grace-Given` is Lord of `Leyndell`, the capital city...at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the `Altus Plateau`. 
            > But the **Two Fingers** forbid us from venturing there. Until we've acquired enough **Great Runes** to repair the **Elden Ring**.
        - `Rennala` is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the `Academy of Raya Lucaria`
            > The `Academy of Raya Lucaria` lies to `Limgrave's` north, towering over the mist-laden lands of `Liurnia`. 
            > Her beloved, `Radagon`, left her to become `Queen Marika's` second husband, taking the title of *King Consort*. The **Great Rune** dwells within the *amber egg* that was `Radagon's` gift to her.
- `Roderika`, referred to as `Heartbroken Maiden` (inside `Stormhill Shack`) made her way here
    - She has taken up an apprenticeship with `Hewg`, learning about *spirit tuning*
- `Diallos`
    > Asks about a woman named `Lanya`, his servant, and asks me to let him know if I find her
- `Smithing Master Hewg`
    > I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains. I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools. <br>
    > Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same. Given time, technique never fails. Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her..." <br>
    > "The girl you brought here...she has a gift for spirit tuning. I saw another one like her, long ago. Their eyes share the same hue".
- `Fia, Deathbed Companion`
    > I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from.
    - Provides *Balchadin's Blessing* in exchange for a hug
    > My dear... Have you ever heard of black knifeprints? Dear Rogier likes to talk of it when abed. The ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain. The black knifes wielded by the assassins who committed the act, along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy. These grand affairs are hardly my forté...But dear Rogier began to weep as he spoke...In truth I've heard tell from someone else, about the black knifeprints that fascinate dear Rogier so.
    - Gave me *Knifeprint Clue*, a simple map showing the location of a *black knifeprint*
- `Enia, the Finger Reader`
    > I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will.
    > Demigods, and even the greater of the champions, are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances.
    > These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters. And should you wish to wield that same power, well... I will lend you the strength of the Fingers.
    > Great Runes are the stuff of demigods: the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring. 
    > Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord. And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished".
- `Nepheli Loux` is the adopted daughter of `Gideon Ofnir`
- `Sorcerer Rogier`
    > The misshapen corpse under Stormveil? That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden. That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.
