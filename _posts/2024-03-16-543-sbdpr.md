# 543 SBDPR

A 5/3/1 variation with an emphasis on hypertrophy and a dedicated upper back day.

## Overview

This variant on the 531 program attempts to improve difficulty scaling and hypertrophy volume.

## Program

Weeks 1-3 consist of 5 workout days: `squat`, `bench`, `deadlift`, `press`, and `row`.

Each workout day consists of 3 phases, each consisting of 3 sets: `warmup`, `workout`, and `burndown`.

Each set is calculated using the [formula](https://forums.t-nation.com/t/5-3-1-how-to-build-pure-strength/281694#by-the-numbers-8) from 531 and the calculated training max (`TM`) for the user.
