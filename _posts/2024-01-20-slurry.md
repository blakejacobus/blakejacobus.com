# Slurry

**Note:** _Consult a professional before applying any changes to the foundation of your home._

Many new homes are built on post-tensioned slabs in the southwest. Oftentimes the dirt and rock along the foundation will give away to water (for various reasons). Slurry can be used to fill these gaps and make it harder for water to penetrate the dirt under the slab.

1. Mix `1` part Portland cement to `5` parts sand and a `1/2` gallon of water (amount will vary based on materials and weather).
1. Shovel mixture into gaps between dirt and slab
1. Backfill with dirt
1. Cover with rock
1. Wait for materials to settle and wet down to test integrity if rain is not in the forecast
