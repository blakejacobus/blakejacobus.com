## Games

I think video games are the pinnacle of entertainment. They combine technology, music, storytelling, and visual arts into an immersive, interactive experience. When I'm not working or spending time with family, this is one of the most accessible ways for me to recharge while still experiencing something new and interesting.

## Music

My time spent playing and creating music has - admittedly - evaporated over the last few years. I still enjoy curating playlists, and I intend to pick up the guitar more frequently as I settle further into fatherhood, but it's a pretty passive hobby at the moment.
