# Play

## Games

It's practically a vice at this point, but I love to play video games. For years they've provided a means to unwind and zone out or fantasize and focus in, depending on what's going on in my life.

They are, in my opinion, the pinnacle of media as they combine music, storytelling, and visual arts into a package that can be directly interacted with. Some are linear; some more abstract, but they all offer unique experiences and messages.
