## Journey

### Roundtable Hold

- `Brother Corhyn`
    > I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the *Two Fingers*, and explore the secrets of the Golden Order.
- `Gideon Ofnir`
    > Oh, this is a rare occasion. I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable. Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome. It is safe here. You may let down your guard. <br>
    > Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune. <br>
    > Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open. And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.
    - Welcomed me after defeating `Godrick` and offered information on the remaining 4 demigods:
        - `Radahn` in the `Caelid Wilds`
        - `Rykard` in `Mt. Gelmir`, west of the `Altus Plateau`; the realm of the **Erdtree**
        - `Morgott the Grace-Given` is Lord of `Leyndell`, the capital city...at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the `Altus Plateau`. 
            > But the **Two Fingers** forbid us from venturing there. Until we've acquired enough **Great Runes** to repair the **Elden Ring**.
        - `Rennala` is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the `Academy of Raya Lucaria`
            > The `Academy of Raya Lucaria` lies to `Limgrave's` north, towering over the mist-laden lands of `Liurnia`. 
            > Her beloved, `Radagon`, left her to become `Queen Marika's` second husband, taking the title of *King Consort*. The **Great Rune** dwells within the *amber egg* that was `Radagon's` gift to her.
- `Roderika`, referred to as `Heartbroken Maiden` (inside `Stormhill Shack`) made her way here
    - She has taken up an apprenticeship with `Hewg`, learning about *spirit tuning*
    - Later on, she warned me about an evil presence in the hold:
        > A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable. And I can hear, from all the way over there...The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can ever hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony...I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls...You should keep your distance, I know you're strong, but please.
- `Diallos`
    > Asks about a woman named `Lanya`, his servant, and asks me to let him know if I find her
- `Smithing Master Hewg`
    > I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains. I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools. <br>
    > Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same. Given time, technique never fails. Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her..." <br>
    > "The girl you brought here...she has a gift for spirit tuning. I saw another one like her, long ago. Their eyes share the same hue".
- `Fia, Deathbed Companion`
    > I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from.
    - Provides *Balchadin's Blessing* in exchange for a hug
    > My dear... Have you ever heard of black knifeprints? Dear Rogier likes to talk of it when abed. The ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain. The black knifes wielded by the assassins who committed the act, along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy. These grand affairs are hardly my forté...But dear Rogier began to weep as he spoke...In truth I've heard tell from someone else, about the black knifeprints that fascinate dear Rogier so.
    - Gave me *Knifeprint Clue*, a simple map showing the location of a *black knifeprint*
    - Also asked me to find the owner of a *Weathered Dagger*, which turned out to be `D, Hunter of the Dead`
        - After giving `D` the dagger, he's later found next to `Fia`, dead
        > "Finally, it is returned to its rightful place. The stolen hallowbrand, of the exalted noble. And now, I must bid you goodbye as well. Though I ask you deliver this message to the Roundtable Hold. I am Fia, Deathbed Companion. Hark, Roundtable. Disturb not the Death of Godwyn, the exalted. We, who humbly live in Death...Live in waiting, to one day welcome our Lord. What right does anyone have to object? Our Lord will rise. The Lord of the many, and the meek."
    - She disappears from `Roundtable Hold`
- `Enia, the Finger Reader`
    > I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will.
    > Demigods, and even the greater of the champions, are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances.
    > These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters. And should you wish to wield that same power, well... I will lend you the strength of the Fingers.
    > Great Runes are the stuff of demigods: the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring. 
    > Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord. And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished".
- `Nepheli Loux` is the adopted daughter of `Gideon Ofnir`
- `Sorcerer Rogier`
    > The misshapen corpse under Stormveil? That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden. That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.
    - I gave him the *Black Knifeprint* for analysis:
        > Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives. Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Rennala. Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard. Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint. Truly, you have my thanks. But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you. If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night, then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh. I would like you to procure it for me. And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.
    - When asked about why he pursues `Ranni's` cursemark, he explained:
        > I'm afraid there's something I must tell you. Do you know of Those Who Live in Death? The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order. By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged. But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them. You may find this peculiar, but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives. These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.

- `Kale`, purveyor of fine goods
- `Melina` appeared at a site of grace and offered an alliance
    > I can play the role of maiden. Turning rune fragments into strength. To aid you in your search for the **Elden Ring**. You need only take me with you. To the foot of the **Erdtree**. <br>
    > Upon the cliff, in `Castle Stormveil`, is a shardbearer. A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered **Elden Ring**. <br>
    > I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the **Erdtree** long ago.
- `Usher of Death, Rosus`, statue indicating nearby dungeons/catacombs
    > Guide and gatekeeper for those returning to the roots
- `Stormfoot Catacombs`
    > A proper death means returning to the **Erdtree**. Have patience. Until the time comes, and the roots call to you.
    - Picked up *Grave Glovewort* and *Ghost Glovewort*
    - Defeated `Erdtree Burial Watchdog` and collected *Noble Sorcerer Ashes*
- `Church of Dragon Communion`, located off the western coast, can be used to exchange dragon hearts for spells
- `Heartbroken Maiden` (inside `Stormhill Shack`) reported that people are being grafted, their body parts added to *the spider* and their remains turned into *chrysalids*
- `Knight Bernahl`, a **Tarnished**, inside `Warmaster's Shack` offered to teach me "battle arts" (*Ashes of War*)
- `Witch Renna`, arrived at the `Church of Elleh` and gave me the *Spirit Calling Bell*, a gift from the former master of `Torrent`
    > How long will it be, I wonder, before the **Tarnished** tire of obeisance to the *Two Fingers*?
- `Bloody Finger Hunter Yura` chastised me about challenging `Flying Dragon Agheel` but also aided me in the fight against `Bloody Finger Nerijus`
    > I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers. Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own. <br>
    > Just remember, no kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.
- `Blaidd`, discovered atop the tower of `Mistwood Ruins` came down to greet me.
    > Kalé sent you, did he? Ever the bloody busybody. Hmm. Maybe to him, you don't seem so strange. The name's Blaidd. I'm looking for a man who goes by "Darriwil."
- `Patches the Untethered`, a **Tarnished**, attacked me in `Murkwater Cave` and then surrendered, offering to sell me goods in the future.
    - Items of note: *Margit's Shackle* and *Stonesword Key*, both 5,000 runes
- `Finger Reader Crone`, east of `Castle Stormveil`, read my fingers...
    > Head to the foundation of gold, **Tarnished**. Traverse `Raya Lucaria`; *"Glintstone Eventide"*, and reunite the *half-crescents*, at the `Grand Lift`.
- `Melina` brought me to `Roundtable Hold` after I reached `Liurnia of the Lakes` by taking a hidden path around `Castle Stormveil`
    > Gathering place of **Tarnished** champions, guided by **Grace**
- `Boc the Seamster` appeared as a tree and referenced a local cave that he was driven out of
    - He was beaten by the demi-humans in `Coastal Cave`. I killed the creatures there and retrieved his *Sewing Needle*
- `Alexander, Iron Fist` warrior jar, was stuck in the ground east of `Castle Stormveil`
    - I freed him, and he gave me *Exalted Flesh*
    - He is traveling eastward to `Redmane Castle` on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted `Caelid Wilds`, where a festival is going to be held
- `Deathtouched Catacombs`
    - Outside the entrance, a spirit lamented
    > Unthinkable. Our hallowed resting plkace is violated. To refuse the Erdtree's call to return, to live within Death...sickening.
    - Defeated `Black Knife Assasin` and collected *Deathroot*, which is is sought after by *Beast Clergyman*
- `Sorcerous Sellen`, found inside `Waypoint Ruins`
    - Exiled from `Raya Lucaria Academy`
    - Offered to teach me sorceries
- `Sorcerer Thops`, inside the `Church of Irith` provided some useful information regarding the `Academy of Raya Lucaria` and the **Erdtree Capital**
    > After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the **Shattering**, the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the **Capital** and the south gate leading here. <br>
    > As you might have guessed, the seals are still active, making entry to the academy impossible without a **glintstone key**. <br>
    > `Sellen` was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy...But `Sellen` was expelled from the academy. Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch.
- `Fringefolk Hero's Grave`
    - Defeated a knight and obtained *Dragon Communion Seal*, which boosts my Dragon Communion incantations
    - Dropped a pot on the *Chariot* and obtained the *Erdtree Greatbow*
    - I hate this dungeon so much
- `D, Hunter of the Dead`, located east of `Saintsbridge`
    - Warns me against going to `Summonwater Village`
    > I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot. Heed my warning. Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.
- `Kenneth Haight`
    > You might have heard of me. Kenneth Haight. Next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave".
    - Asks me to take back his fort, to the south of `Mistwood`, from a Knight commander who overtook it
    > I would take great care to avoid Godrick's Tarnished hunts, were I in your shoes. That depraved lot are obsessed with sacrificing Tarnished like you for the sake of "grafting."
    > Honestly, `Godrick’s` no more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don’t make me laugh. First he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from `Radahn` in that castle… Then he insulted `Malenia`, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man.

#### Stormveil Castle

- `Sorcerer Rogier`, located in a chapel in the northwest region of `Stormveil Castle`, offered to teach me some battle arts, as a fellow **Tarnished**
    - Left a message
        > Surely what you seek is somewhere close by...
    - Led me to into the castle's crypt, where I defeated an `Ulcerated Tree Spirit` and discovered the following: 
        - Bloodstain of `Sorcerer Rogier` being killed
        - *Prince of Death's Pustule*
        - Massive petrified skeleton down here, of which only the head, sprouting tentacles, remains...
- `Nepheli Loux`, located near the `Secluded Cell` in `Stormveil Castle`, is another Tarnished operating on orders from her father.
    > If you intend to challenge Godrick, I ask you call upon me. The winds run could with his deeds. I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight.
    - Relation to `Hoarah Loux` from the [introduction](#introduction)?
- `Godrick the Grafted` defeated
    - Obtained *Godrick's Great Rune*
        > The **Great Runes** you receive by defeating **shardbearers** have lost their beneficial power. However, their power can be restored at **Divine Towers** throughout the `Lands Between`
        > See the description of each **Great Rune** to discover which **Divine Tower** you should visit.
        - Seek the `Divine Tower of Limgrave`, which stands beyond the great bridge from `Stormveil Castle`
            - Restored the rune at the tower, in what appears to be a petrified version of two fingers sprouting from the ground
                > The **Great Rune** is known as the anchor ring, found in the center of the **Elden Ring**
                > The first demigods were The **Elden Lord Godfrey** and his offspring, the **golden lineage**
    - Obtained *Remembrance of the Grafted*
        - Power can be unlocked by the **Finger Reader**    
            - Unlocks *Axe of Godrick* or *Grafted Dragon*, neither of which I care for

### Weeping Peninsula

- Grace uniquely pointing south; following it to see why
- `Irina`, a blind woman on the side of the road, and an escapee from `Castle Morne`
    - Asked me to take a letter to her father there, to convince him to leave
    - After speaking with her father, I returned to find her dead with a curved sword left next to her body.
- `Ailing Village` is infested with *Frenzy* and *yellow ember*, a source of it
- An ethereal candelabrum appeared ___ and led me to `Earthbore Cave`
    - Inside was a nest of rats and a *Runebear*, which dropped the *Spelldrake Talisman*
- `Church of Pilgrimage`, located at the north peak of the `Weeping Peninsula`
    - A `Stranded Soul` outside speaks of the `Wandering Mausoleum`:
        > The mausoleum prowls. Cradling the soulless demigod. O Marika, Queen Eternal. He is your unwanted child. 
    - Melina interacts while resting here:
        > Spoken echoes linger here. Words of Queen Marika, who vanished long ago. If you wish, I will share them with you. In Marika's own words.     Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed. Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring. Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.
- `Minor Erdtree`
    - An `Erdtree Avatar` is protecting it, as well as various minor guardians, but there doesn't seem to be anything of note near the tree.
- `Wandering Mausoleum`
    - I duplicated the *Remembrance of the Grafted*
- `Tower of Return`
    - I was transported to the `Divine Bridge` of `Lendyll, Royal Capital` and defeated the giant that was waiting at the end of the bridge.
    - There is a transporter, assumedly for the nearby *Divine Tower*, but I cannot use it right now.
    - Picked up the *Blessed Dew Talisman*, which slowly restores HP
- `Witchbane Ruins`
    - `Sorceress Sellen` is held prisoner inside 
- `Edgar`, the warden of `Castle Morne` and `Irina's` father, said that he cannot leave the castle until he has fulfilled his duty
    > The menials have all rebelled. They gave me good service, or so I thought, but it seems it was all an act. Foul creatures, as it's said.
    > I see, from Irina... Thank you. I'm in your debt. But I can't leave yet. Even if the castle should fall, as commander, I must remain. To ensure the treasured sword of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands. If you see Irina, do tell her. That her father will come for her, once he's fulfilled his duty.
    - Upon finding Irina's body, he vows to hunt down the monster who killed her.
    - Attacked me in Liurnia of the Lakes (Edgar the Revenger)
- `Leonine Misbegotten` was found and slain at the southern peninsula beyond `Castle Morne`
    - Dropped *Grafted Blade Greatsword*

### Liurnia of the Lakes

- `Rya the Scout` asked me to help her retrieve a stolen necklace
    > It's rather chilly here, isn't it? My mistress sent me off on an errand...But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind. Could I ask you to lend a hand, perhaps? That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it. Only... He, too, is **Tarnished**. If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another...
    - I retrieved her necklace from the thug by buying it back,, and she gave me *Volcano Manor Invitation*.
    > I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor.
    > You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand, but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind. Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks.
    > Brave Tarnished, seek the `Altus Plateau`, the realm of the **Erdtree**...the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions.
    > This land of Liurnia is connected to the `Altus Plateau` by the *Grand Lift of Dectus*, beyond the `High Road`. But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage. Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff. At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel. It was excavated from both ends, linking `Liurnia` to the `Altus Plateau`.
- `Patches` in the middle of the lake, who gave me a tip on reaching the **Erdtree**
    > There's a surviving *Iron Virgin* at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the `Academy of Raya Lucaria`. And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the **Erdtree**.
- Discovered the `Village of the Albinaurics` and a sole survivor: `Albus`, disguised as a pot, who asks me to protect an item: **Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right)**
    > Wait, then, you're not one of them? Well, what a relief... Oh, goodness me. I am Albus. An Albinauric, as you can see. We are finished. The whole village is finished. The cursemongers have destroyed everything. Not one that remains has their wits about them I beg you. Would you look after this medallion? You must keep it out of the cursemonger's hands. And if you should meet the young Albinauric `Latenna`, then please, give it to her. A chosen land awaits us Albinaurics. The medallion is the key that leads to the city. It's only a quaint treasure, for we who cannot make the journey. But for dear `Latenna`, it is needed. To fulfill her purpose.
- `Edgar` (the Revenger), the warden of `Castle Morne`, whose daughter (`Irina`) was killed in the `Weeping Peninsula` attacked me
    > ...Ahh the poor fellow... Gone perfectly mad. Love... Revenge....the frenzied flame melts it all away...
- `Latenna`, located outside `Lakeside Crystal Cave`, near the `Slumbering Wolf's Shack` offered to follow me in her effort to collect the **Haligtree Secret Medallion** halves.
    - I gave her the medallion provided by `Albus`, which earned her trust.
    > Would you consider doing me a great service? I must go back. There is something that I must do, even if I must say farewell to my wolf, `Lobo`. Will you show me the way? To the land of *Miquella's Haligtree*.
    > They say the other half of the medallion is beyond the forbidden lands north of the **Erdtree**. In `Castle Sol`, on the `Mountaintops of the Giants`, accessible by the *Grand Lift of Rold*. 
    - I can call on her spirit, as needed.
- `Diallos`, near `Academy Gate Town` was grieving over the body of his servant, `Lanya`
    > Hello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you. The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends. The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished.
    > "The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood." I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.
    > The location of the recusant hideout. It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west from the town of windmills. That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.
    - He seems to be referring to `Rya` and `Lady Tanith` of `Volcano Manor`
- `Glintstone Dragon Smarag` was defeated, dropping a *dragon heart* for use at the `Cathedral of Dragon Communion`
- `The Four Belfries` are waygates to other locations in the game, unlocked with *Imbued Sword Keys*
- Found *Gold Sewing Needle* in `Church of Vows` that allows `Boc` to alter certain *armor* pieces
- In the `Carian Study Hall`, located a pedestal lacking an object of some sort
    - Inside, a spirit referenced the "transgressions of the princess"
- Found `Blackknife Catacombs`, the place `Fia` and `Rogier` mentioned
    - Inside was *Rosus's Axe*, the "Usher of Death" that points to the catacombs across the **Lands Between**
    - Also found the *Black Knifeprint* requested by Rogier
- `Converted Fringe Tower`, a message and a puzzle:
    > May erudition light the way!"
    - You must solve the puzzle to enter
- Met `Ranni the Witch` in `Ranni's Rise, Three Sisters`
    > I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met.
    > I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path. That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before.
    - She had previously introduced herself as `Renna` in `Limgrave`
    - I agreed to enter into her service, along with `Blaidd`, `Iji`, and `Seluvis`, to recover hidden treasure of `Nokron, the Eternal City`.
- `Iji`, war counsellor for `Ranni`, greeted me at the bottom of her tower.
    > I am Iji. A blacksmith who once served the Carian royals. An old codger who refuses to retire his rusty hammer. So, here I am, still quietly plying my trade, on this spot.
- `Blaidd`, who I met before in `Mistwood` told me that he was looking for the road to `Nokron` beneath `Limgrave`
    > I’m still in Limgrave. The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land. I’m planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood. See if I can’t find the road to Nokron from there…
- `Seluvis`, an officious prick, and the third partner in `Ranni's` service, was last to greet me as I left her tower.
    > I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you, but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady, I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you.
    > I reside...in another tower, close by. Come and pay me a visit...Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni.
    - He asked me to find a woman named `Nepheli` and give her a potion

### Sofria River

- I took `Sofria River Well` downward in search of `eternal city of Nokron` with `Blaidd`
- Lit a torch near the river bank
    - Found several others, and they seem to correspond with torches on a stairwell near the riverbank site of **Grace**
    - Took a portal that led northeast, connecting to the riverbank, where a dragon kin dwells within a small lake
    - Killed the dragon kin and lot all the torches
        > Power gathers somewhere in horned remains
        - Went to `Hallowhorn Ground` and defeated `Ancestor Spirit`
- Found `Blaidd`, who said he'd exhausted all paths he could find to `Nekron`, floating above us, and said `Seluvis` might know a path forward if we can't find out way
    - `Seluvis` told me to go talk to `Sellen`, who provided guidance on how to reach Nekron
        > If `General Radahn` were to die, the stars would resume their movement. And so, too, would Ranni's destiny.

### Caelid

- Returned here in search of `General Radahn`, looking for the festival that `Alexander` mentioned
    - `Gideon` said that he fought `Melania` and her "rot" in `Caelid` and is likely still there, though he may not look like his former self...

    - ...or give it to `Gideon`, who believes that `Seluvis` is a piece of shit and that `Nepheli` (his daughter) isn't herself
